# Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences!

[This repository](https://codeberg.org/tommi/csss 'csss repository on Codeberg') hosts [Tommi](https://tommi.space/home#about 'About Tommi')‚Äôs [bachelor‚Äôs thesis](https://tommi.space/csss.pdf), written between February and June 2023.

Note: unfortunately, I was not considerate enough to keep track of my work through git progressively. This repository has been created later, in April 2024. Hence, the commits up to that date *do not* reflect the actual moment when the content was created. Hopefully, I will be able to create commits step by step in the future.

## Workshop: *Sewing Our Internet*

Since I feel very strongly about the topics of this thesis, I have been thinking hard of ways to inform and involve people.
Out of this effort, a workshop came out, and I had the honour and pleasure to host it in many occasions with diverse crowds of various ages.

The workshop is called [***Sewing Our Internet***](https://tommi.space/sewnet 'Sewing our Internet, tommi.space').

## Feedback and corrections

I am keen to discuss about anything related to this thesis! Get in touch if you‚Äôd like!

I wrote my thesis as a young undergraduate student. Even if it is highly unlikely, there might be information that is partly or even fully incorrect. I apologise for this, and I invite you to contact me if you spot any kind of mistake!

### Obsolescence

The text of the thesis **is not being updated**. Please, be aware that there might be information that becomes incorrect or wrong because of obsolescence.

## Build process

I am technically goofy (actually, not only technically) to say the least, and the build process for this thesis is fragmented and messy. I know the right way to parse the final PDF including citations, markup, frontispiece, etc. would be to use a Makefile. I tried. I failed miserably. Therefore, below are the admittedly weird but effective build steps to get to the final thesis in PDF format.

1. Markdown ‚Üí HTML conversion, using Pandoc: <pre><code>pandoc -s 'Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.md' --wrap=none --resource-path="$PWD" --metadata-file='Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.yml' -C -o 'Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.html'</code></pre>
2. HTML ‚Üí LaTeX conversion, using Pandoc: <pre><code>pandoc -s 'Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.html' --wrap=none --resource-path="$PWD" --metadata-file='Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.yml' -C -o 'Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.tex'</code></pre>
3. Build the final `.tex` file using `pdflatex`: <pre><code>pdflatex 'Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences.tex'</code></pre>

Please, refer to [my technical notes](https://tommi.space/pandoc-workflow/ 'Academic writing with Pandoc ‚Äì tommi.space') to try to understand more (good luck with that).
