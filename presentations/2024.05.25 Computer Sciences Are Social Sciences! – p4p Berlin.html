<h2>The birth of the Internet</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Baran’s concept had the same <strong>centrifugal</strong> character
that defines the Internet today. At its most basic, … the “centrifugal”
approach is <u>to flatten established hierarchies and put power and
responsibility at the nodal level</u> so that each node is equal.
Baran’s network focused on what he called <q><u>user to user rather than
… centre-to-centre operation</u></q>.</p>

<h2>Collaboration, that stranger</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>At the core of Licklider’s thinking was <u>an emphasis on
collaboration</u>. Licklider posited a future scenario in which a
researcher at one research centre could find a useful computer resource
over the network from a research centre elsewhere. This, in a world of
incompatible machines and jealously guarded computing resources, was
far-sighted talk indeed.</p>

<h2>The Internet of the ’90s</h2>
<ul>
<li>a widespread <em>diffidence</em> by non-experts towards digital
telecommunications, because of its subversive <em>complexity</em>, but
also because of…</li>
<li>…a fundamental <em>counter-intuitiveness</em> of the infrastructure,
based on…</li>
<li>…a heavily <em>decentralized</em> system, where no main node exists,
and whose effectiveness is based on the <em>distribution</em> and
<em>redundancy</em> of information and computing resources;</li>
<li>a focus on <em>collaboration</em>, on <em>sharing ideas</em> and
resources, on commonly defined standards allowing
<em>interoperability</em>;</li>
<li>both a strive and a drive for <em>interconnecting</em> concepts,
users, and devices;</li>

<h2>The Internet of the 2020s</h2>
<ul>
<li>a widespread <strong>blind reliance</strong> on digital
telecommunication tools by non-experts;</li>
<li>…that compose <strong>appealing</strong> and
<strong>intuitive</strong> platforms, nicely and masterfully simplified
by exploiting…</li>
<li>…a strong and almost inescapable <strong>centralization</strong>
carried out by monopolistic <strong>profit-driven</strong>
companies;</li>
<li>a strongly <strong>competitive</strong> business, inherited by the
deeply capitalist culture the <em>dot com bubble</em> represented;</li>
<li>as with anything inscribed within a capitalist economic system,
technological innovation is carried out in parallel by the isolated
silos that are the different companies potentially working on the same
project, and <strong>competing</strong> to overcome the others rather
than join forces with the common purpose of providing the best service
possible;</li>
<li>interconnection opportunity is functional and <strong>subordinate to
the monetization</strong> and the general profitability of digital
devices;</li>
<li>Computer Sciences and the Internet are not merely strongly tied with
finance, but they are directly <strong>dominated by the market</strong>,
and their principles are more financial ones rather than technological
and human ones.</li>

<h2>Philosophy <em>in</em> Science</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[Philosophy in Science] is dedicated to fostering the pursuit of a

<h2>Digital Humanities?</h2>
<p>Subverting and revolutionizing the relation between humanities and

infrastructures</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-essence-of-technology" class="slide level2">
<h2>The essence of technology</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology is not equivalent to the essence of technology. When we
are seeking the essence of “tree,” we have to become aware that that
which pervades every tree, as tree, is not itself a tree that can be
encountered among all the other trees.</p>
<p>Likewise, the essence of technology is by no means anything
technological. Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the
essence of technology so long as we merely conceive and push forward the
technological, put up with it, or evade it. Everywhere we remain unfree
and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it.
But <u>we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we
regard it as something neutral</u>; for this conception of it, to which
today we particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the
essence of technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Martin Heidegger, <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em></p>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>But this much remains correct: <u>modern technology too is a means to
an end</u>. That is why the instrumental conception of technology
conditions every attempt to bring man into the right relation to
technology. <u>Everything depends on our manipulating technology in the
proper manner as a means</u>. We will, as we say, “get” technology
“spiritually in hand.” We will master it. <u>The will to mastery becomes
all the more urgent the more technology threatens to slip from human
control</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="max-weber" class="slide level2">
<h2>Max Weber</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that what is called the technological development of modern
times has been so largely oriented economically to profit-making is one
of the fundamental facts of the history of technology. […] the main
emphasis at all times, and especially the present, has lain in <u>the
economic determination of technological development</u>. Had not
rational calculation formed the basis of economic activity, had there
not been certain very particular conditions in its economic background,
<u>rational technology could never have come into existence</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="surveillance-capitalism-is-not-technology"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Surveillance Capitalism is not Technology</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Surveillance capitalism is not technology</u>; it is a logic that
imbues technology and commands it into action. Surveillance capitalism
is a market form that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu, but it
is not the same as the “digital”. […] surveillance capitalists want us
to think that their practices are inevitable expressions of the
technologies they employ.</p>

<section id="karl-marx" class="slide level2">
<h2>Karl Marx</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The bourgeoisie cannot exist without <strong>constantly
revolutionising the instruments of production</strong>, and thereby the
relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on
the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier
industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production,
uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting
uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all
earlier ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="automating-inequalities">Automating inequalities</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The skyrocketing economic insecurity of the last decade has been
accompanied by an equally rapid rise of sophisticated data-based
technologies in public services: predictive algorithms, risk models, and
automated eligibility systems. Massive investments in data-driven
administration of public programs are rationalized by a call for
efficiency, doing more with less, and getting help to those who really
need it. But the uptake of these tools is occurring at a time when
<strong>programs that serve the poor are as unpopular as they have ever
been</strong>. This is not a coincidence. Technologies of poverty
management are not neutral. They are shaped by our nation’s fear of
economic insecurity and hatred of the poor; they in turn shape the
politics and experience of poverty.</p>
