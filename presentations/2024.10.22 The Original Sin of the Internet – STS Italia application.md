What was the spark that ignited the degeneration of the Internet? How did it turn from an open and decentralized resource to a corporate system of **surveillance capitalism**?

[Tommaso Marmo](https://tommi.space/)’s research travels through contemporary history up to **the early days of the Internet**, with the aim of pinpointing its original sin, **the pivotal event that has had a long-lasting impact on its trajectory**.

This endeavour is carried out through the broader effort of studying the sociological and philosophical nature of **decentralized networks**, in Marmo’s thesis [***Computer Sciences are Social Sciences**, An enquiry concerning the need of a philosophical approach to the digital domain*](https://csss.tommi.space).

The panel would last around one hour, and it would include a 30 minutes keynote followed by a 30 minutes interactive informal workshop, [***Knitting Our Internet***](https://ournet.rocks/).

The final purpose of this panel is not only to explore the history of the Internet adopting a critical phenomenological approach, but also to envision and explore practices of political self-determination within the digital domain, in particular **through the case study of the *Fediverse***.
